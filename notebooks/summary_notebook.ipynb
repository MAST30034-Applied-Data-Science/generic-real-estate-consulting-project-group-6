    "Improving living standards has boosted people's requirements for a living environment. For many people, selecting an cost-effective property has become a complicated problem. Companies and individuals who want to invest in real estate may also hesitate because of uncertainty about the direction of the properties' prices and the return on Investment (ROI). The summary notebook demonstrates the overall approach of our findings on the trend and influential features of the property rental price for suburbs and recommendations for choosing an affordable and livable suburb for our stakeholders.\n"
